# EcoNet EN751221
The EN751221 family consists nominally of the [EN7512](/EN7512), EN7513, EN7521 and EN7526. However, there are significant similarities with EN7520, to the point that EN751221 kernel is likely to boot okay.

Hardware specific to the EN751221 family includes:
* [EN751221 Interrupt Controller](en751221-intc)
* [EN751221 SPI Controller](en751221-spi)

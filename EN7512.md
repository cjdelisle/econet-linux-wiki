# EN7512
The page contains the current linux mainline status of the different hardware in the EN712 family of SoCs.


## EFUSE
TBD

## GDMA (removed staging driver)
Generic DMA
The driver for ralink DMA is similar.
[Source code](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/staging/ralink-gdma/ralink-gdma.c?h=v5.4.291)

### Specifications
[Chapter 2.11, page 154](http://gw.stasoft.net/share/nts/datasheets/MT7621_ProgrammingGuide_Preliminary_Platform.pdf) 


## GPIO/Pinctrl (WIP)
GPIO controller
Driver based on an7581-pinctrl.c has been written and should work.


## I2C (present in kernel tree)
I2C
The same driver as for the MT7621 should work.
[Source code](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mt7621.c?h=v6.13.7)

### Specifications
[Chapter 2.7, page 49](http://gw.stasoft.net/share/nts/datasheets/MT7621_ProgrammingGuide_Preliminary_Platform.pdf) 

## Switch (present in kernel tree)
Internal switch.
The switch is MT7530-based and the same code for the AN7581 should work. The switch also provide the MDIO-bus.
[Source code](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/dsa/mt7530-mmio.c)


## UART (patches posted)
Serial port, the EN7512 has 2 ports.
The UART seems to be the same as in other SoCs from EcoNet/Airoha.
[Patches](https://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg772090.html)


## USB2/USB3
TBD
